# Maker Portfolio
My maker portfolio showcases two game bots created for my AP Computer Science A class competitions and demonstrates my programming work for fun outside of computational astrophysics research. 
## [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS)](/rpsls/)
**My bot: [BreadBot.java](/rpsls/BreadBot.java)<br>**
**How to run: Run [RPSLSArena.java](/rpsls/RPSLSArena.java). Feel free to change the players in the round-robin tournament<br>**
A variant of rock-paper-scissors with two new moves. Bots compete against each other in a round-robin tournament with 10,000 moves per round, awarding 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, and 0 points for a loss. No bot is allowed to only use random, except for [RandoCalrissian](/rpsls/RandoCalrissian.java) made by my teacher. <br><br>
## [Paintball](/paintball/)
**My bot: [BreadBrain.java](/paintball/src/brains/BreadBrain.java)<br>**
**How to run: Run [PaintballMain.java](/paintball/src/arena/PaintballMain.java). Feel free to change team fill method in reset() or the players facing off in the methods in reset().**<br>
Simulated paintball with bots. Two teams compete against each other for the most amount of points. Players can move, turn, and shoot players, shots, and bases. Points are awarded for eliminating enemies and shooting bases, and points are deducted for eliminating teammates, shooting one's base, and being eliminated. Note that this project is suggested to be ran on [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/).
